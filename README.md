## About `consulting-luc-f21`
A repository for sharing resources for Statistical Consulting at Loyola University Chicago, Fall 2021

## Suggestions

* Documents/papers/slides in `.pdf` format are strongly preferred.

* Word and powerpoint files (`.docx`, `.ppt`) are also fine, but discouraged. Ditto for data files with `.xlsx` and `.xls` extensions.

Cheers.
